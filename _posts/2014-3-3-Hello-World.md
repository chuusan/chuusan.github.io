title: A Brief Introduction to Variance
---

To help you learn better about the `variance`. I find you a job at an Apple battery supplier (btw you are welcome!), Your job is to test the battery lifespan. 

On your first day of work, you are asked to submit a report regarding the batteries' lifespan for their newest iPad. Your manager told you that the average lifespan of these batteries is 1000 days $E(X)=1000$. One of your colleague thinks that the mean value is sufficient for your report. But actually:

- _It is possible that the majority of the batteries have a lifespan between 950 days and 1050 days._

- _It is also possible that about half of these batteries have a good performance of about 1300 days, however, the half left only have a lifespan of approximately 700 days._

To better learn the performance of these batteries, you need to mention the difference between the lifespan $L$ and the average lifespan $E(X)=1000$ in your report. But here comes the question. "How can you measure the difference?"
